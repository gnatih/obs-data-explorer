"Budgets are a government's most powerful tool to meet the needs and "
"priorities of a country and its people. Civil society organizations, "
"legislators, auditors, the media, and the broader public need timely budget "
"information to hold the government accountable for how it uses public "
"resources. Without such scrutiny, the government can make bad choices on "
"unpopular or inappropriate programs, waste money, and open the door to "
"corruption. On the other hand, when ordinary people have information and "
"opportunities to participate in government budget processes, they can "
"promote real improvements in governance and policy."
